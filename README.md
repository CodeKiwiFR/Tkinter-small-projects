# Tkinter-small-projects
Small projects made in order to learn about python programming and tkinter GUI:
- contact_manager is a small app made in order to learn about file management
- snake is a replica from the famous game but, for the moment, you cannot die :)
- circle_collision is just an animation in which some disks are colliding each other
- circle_rotation is another animation in which circles are rotating around a point (yes I am a beginner)
- mini_drawer is a tiny app in which you can draw things

All those projects are small and were made for teaching myself about python and tkinter.
They do not work perfectly and some of them are not complete.
