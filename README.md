# Tkinter-small-projects
Small projects made in order to learn about python programming and tkinter GUI:<br><br>

### BlackJack
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This not a tkinter project (yes, very logic to put it here).<br>
  It is a console Blackjack game which was my first OOP project with Python.<br>
  It only works on unix systems (I use the os clear command which is not available on windows - I should correct this but am lazy)<br>
  </p>

### Contact_manager
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This a small app made in order to learn about file management.<br>
  You can create contacts and save them to a file. Oldschool but interesting.

### snake
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This a replica from the famous game but, for the moment, you cannot die :)<br>
  One day I will complete this small project, or not.

### circle_collision
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This just an animation in which some disks are colliding each other.

</details>

### circle_rotation
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This another animation in which circles are rotating around a point (yes I am a beginner and happy to be :p).

### mini_drawer
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This a tiny app in which you can draw things.
  </p>
</details>

### dices
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  Small application which enables you to roll dices and keep some of them.<br>
  This is inspired by the Yathzee, but not a full game project (but it would be a good idea for a network game)
  </p>
</details>

### OscilloProject
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  <p>
  This app offers you a small oscillograph. You can draw some curves and adjust all the parameters.<br>
  Interesting project :)

All those projects are small and were made for teaching myself about python and tkinter.
They do not work perfectly and some of them are not complete.
