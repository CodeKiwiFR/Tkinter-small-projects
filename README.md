# Tkinter-small-projects
Small projects made in order to learn about python programming and tkinter GUI:<br><br>

### BlackJack
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
This not a tkinter project (yes, very logic to put it here).<br>
It is a console Blackjack game which was my first OOP project with Python.<br>
!!!!! It only works on unix systems (I use the os clear command which is not available on windows - I should correct this but am lazy)<br>

<details><summary>Contact_manager</summary>
<p>
This a small app made in order to learn about file management.<br>
You can create contacts and save them to a file. Oldschool but interesting.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>snake</summary>
<p>
This a replica from the famous game but, for the moment, you cannot die :)<br>
One day I will complete this small project, or not.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>**circle_collision**</summary>
<p>
This just an animation in which some disks are colliding each other.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>circle_rotation</summary>
<p>
This another animation in which circles are rotating around a point (yes I am a beginner and happy to be :p).
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>mini_drawer</summary>
<p>
This a tiny app in which you can draw things.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>dices</summary>
<p>
Small application which enables you to roll dices and keep some of them.<br>
This is inspired by the Yathzee, but not a full game project (but it would be a good idea for a network game)
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>OscilloProject</summary>
<p>
This app offers you a small oscillograph. You can draw some curves and adjust all the parameters.<br>
Interesting project :)

All those projects are small and were made for teaching myself about python and tkinter.
They do not work perfectly and some of them are not complete.
