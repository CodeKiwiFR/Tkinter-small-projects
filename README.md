# Tkinter-small-projects
Small projects made in order to learn about python programming and tkinter GUI:<br><br>
### Blackjack
This not a tkinter project (yes, very logic to put it here).<br>
It is a console Blackjack game which was my first OOP project with Python.<br>
!!!!! It only works on unix systems (I use the os clear command which is not available on windows - I should correct this but am lazy)<br>
### Contact_manager
This a small app made in order to learn about file management.<br>
You can create contacts and save them to a file. Oldschool but interesting.
### snake
This a replica from the famous game but, for the moment, you cannot die :)<br>
One day I will complete this small project.
### circle_collision
This just an animation in which some disks are colliding each other.
### circle_rotation
This another animation in which circles are rotating around a point (yes I am a beginner and happy to be :p).
### mini_drawer
This a tiny app in which you can draw things.

All those projects are small and were made for teaching myself about python and tkinter.
They do not work perfectly and some of them are not complete.
